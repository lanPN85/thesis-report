\section{BK.Synapse - A Framework for Distributed Neural Network Training}
We present a tool and framework for training neural networks in a distributed manner called BK.Synapse.

\subsection{Overview \& Motivation}
BK.Synapse provides a complete set of tools for training neural networks, including model and dataset managements, training configuration, monitoring and exporting results, combined with an intuitive, no-configuration distributed environment.

The use-cases and general design for BK.Synapse are inspired by NVIDIA DIGITS.
